- Mostly discussion to clear up misconceptions and get on the right path
- Plan should incorporate (a lot of) repetition
- Many variables such as the length of the array and the luckiest/unluckiest occurrences should be tested.
- Instead of counting how many times the for loop runs, utilize currentTimeMilis, which measures the difference in start and end time

- Solved remaining issues
- Put code in SearchDriver
  - with BinSearch, no matter how small or large the array is, we end up with 0 ms
  - made helper methods (testLinSearch and testBinSearch to condense code)
  - put best and worst cases for 10_000_000, 25_000_000, 50_000_000

- Discussed about the issue of getting 0 ms for BinSearch no matter the size of the array
  - Some groups have reported to have discovered this as well
  - SOLUTION: Find the elapsed time for multiple trials instead of just one
- Was told that notes.txt and log.txt have to have headings
