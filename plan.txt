Plan:
1) Comment out unnecessary parts of code so that both methods are on the same playing field
 - Definition of unnecessary code: Code that does not contribute towards the goal of finding the target
2) Make a table consisting of the size of the array and the amount of time it takes
 - The table is our collection of data.
3) There will be 4 different sizes of arrays: 10, 100, 1000, and 10000
 - See how BinSearch and LinSearch compare when the arrays have less or more elements.
4) REPETITION: Each trial will be conducted 5 times (for both BinSearch and LinSearch), and the average will be the time taken. This is to prevent from any run-through with external forces in play.

- Changing the location of the target would change the amount of time it takes to find it. We are going to keep the location constant.

To use currentTimeMillis:
- public static long currentTimeMillis()
- System.currentTimeMillis() instead of System.out.println(currentTimeMillis())
- We would put this before and after we use the method. Then, we find the difference between the two times.
