Plan:
1) Comment out unnecessary parts of code so that both methods are on the same playing field
 - Definition of unnecessary code: Code that does not contribute towards the goal of finding the target
2) Record data consisting of the size of the array and the amount of time it takes
 - This will be showin in "Results" in README.md
3) There will be 4 different sizes of arrays: 1_000_000, 10_000_000, 25_000_000, and 50_000_000
 - See how BinSearch and LinSearch compare when the arrays have less or more elements.
4) REPETITION: Each trial will be conducted 50 times (for both BinSearch and LinSearch), and the acccumulated time will be recorded. (We originally decided to record the average of the times taken, but we were unable to have a BinSearch that would be more than 0 ms. With the accumulated time, we hope to be able to record a BinSearch > 0.)

- The location of the target will be not in array. This is the worse case scenario for both methods. We will compare the results relative to array size.

To use currentTimeMillis:
- public static long currentTimeMillis()
- System.currentTimeMillis() instead of System.out.println(currentTimeMillis())
- We would put this before and after we use the method. Then, we find the difference between the two times.
