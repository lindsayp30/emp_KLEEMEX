EMPIRICAL: numerical

Ideas to Test Which is Faster: BinSearch or LinSearch
- Count the number of steps each method takes
- Measure it amount of time it takes for the method to run via currentTimeMillis

ESSENTIAL: REPETITION
- measure time via currentTimeMillis

N: Unnecessary code can make the run time longer.

PIAZZA:
- to make large numbers more readable: utilize underscores
example: 1_000_000

Suggestion from Kosta:
Utilize a for loop in our main method to efficiently conduct many trials.

Small numbers (like 1,000) get searched by LinSearch and BinSearch lightning fast
