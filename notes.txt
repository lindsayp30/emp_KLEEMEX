EMPIRICAL:
- numerical

Ideas to Test Which is Faster: BinSearch or LinSearch
- Count the number of steps each method takes
- Measure it amount of time it takes for the method to run via currentTimeMillis

ESSENTIAL TO REMEMBER:
- REPETITION
- measure time via currentTimeMillis

N: Unnecessary code can make the run time longer.

PIAZZA:
- to make large numbers more readable: utilize underscores
  - example: 1_000_000

Suggestion from Kosta:
- Utilize a for loop in our main method to efficiently conduct many trials.

N: BinSearch is very fast. The work-around around the 0ms results is to find the elapsed time of many trials.

GALLERY TOUR:
- Team Frogs
  - Used an average of 100 trials
  - Target location: not in array
  - Guess as to why there is an initial lag: program just started

- Team Compile Time Error
  - Runs binTrial using a while loop until the number is significant (>0)
  - Multiplies linTrial value by the number of times binTrial is ran
  - The number of trials ran is RELATIVE to binTrial

- Team BPK
  - Runs 1000 trials via while loop, prints both the average and the total time
  - Uses a 2D array where the first value is binSearch and the second is linSearch
  - Target location: not in array
  - They noticed that Task Manager spikes during the initial power up of the program, but decreases afterwards
