EMPIRICAL: numerical

Ideas to Test Which is Faster: BinSearch or LinSearch
- Count the number of steps each method takes
- Measure it amount of time it takes for the method to run via currentTimeMillis

ESSENTIAL: REPETITION
- measure time via currentTimeMillis

N: Unnecessary code can make the run time longer.
